=No Nautilus context menu icons=

If you notice that the context menu icons are not showing up in Nautilus, this is actually the result of a decision by GNOME upstream to cease displaying icons in menus by default.

You can change this behaviour by right clicking on the desktop, then select “Change Desktop Background” » Interface » Show Icons in Menus

…or try running:

gconftool-2 –type bool –set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons true

(You can also use Applications > System Tools > Configuration editor, browse to that key and check the box.)
