Main features:  
  * Without any configuration more than one user can use their own PagaVCS instance. In te 1.4.x series the communicaion port had to be tweaked in the config file. Now the internal communication is based on unix-domain-socket now instead of plain socket.
  * No longer supported: 9.10 Karmic, 10.04 Lucid, 10.10 Maverick, 11.04 Natty. Use the 1.4.x series with them ([PagaVCS14Series See more])
  * The Launchpad PPA repository is the only one to use for 1.5.x. The googlecode's repository is still available for 1.4.x.
