 * factory class will be associated with a writer class, and its code will look something like:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyWriterFactory implements ConfigurationWriterFactory {
 *    public ConfigurationWriter getWriterInstance() {return new MyWriter();}
 * }
 * </pre>

 * The <code>com.mucommander.conf</code> package comes with a default implementation, {@link XmlConfigurationWriterFactory},
 * which creates writers meant to handle the standard muCommander configuration file format.
